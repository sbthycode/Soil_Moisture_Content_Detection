# Soil_Moisture_Content_Detection
The project essentially aims at monitoring water content in soil and to notify the user as and when the water content drops below a certain threshold. This project targets users with indoor plants with special and specific water requirement. It can also be used to curb excessive water consumption in drought ridden areas.

# Prerequisites and Requirements for the Project
1. Node MCU
2. UNderstanding Arduino( A basic understanding of C/C++ syntax, since, arduino runs on a C similar language)
3. Soil Moisture Sensor Module
4. Understanding of Blynk library under Arduino and its application available for smartphones.
